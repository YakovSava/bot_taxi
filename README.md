## Preface
Actually, this is a freelance project and it should not be publicly available so that all sorts of "advanced programmers" (*beginners*) do not make their corrections, and then ask what is wrong.

## How to use it ~~shit~~ program?
It's simple:
- Insert it into *config.py* tokens from *VK group*, *Dadata* and *QiwiP2P*
- Prescribe in the terminal ```python main.py```
- Using the admin set *cost* command where *cost* is a number (!!!) waiting for someone to poy ("pay" with an error) you
- Oh, yes, I almost forgot, I still need to go to *parameters.json* insert the *ID of the grou*p and *admin user ID*, otherwise the bot will send you far and for a long time

## IMPORTANT
I don't mind someone using this library, if you use the code from here somewhere, PLEASE mention me, I tried :3
